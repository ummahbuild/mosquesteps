## Reporting Issues

We use **GitHub Issues** with templates so we get the information we need quickly.

### Issue templates

| Template | When to use | Link |
|----------|-------------|------|

## Contributing Code

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (recommend LTS)
- **npm** or **bun**
- **Git**

### Setup and workflow

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub: [github.com/ummahbuild/mosquesteps](https://github.com/ummahbuild/mosquesteps) → Fork.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mosquesteps.git
   cd mosquesteps
   ```
3. **Add upstream** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ummahbuild/mosquesteps.git
   ```
4. **Install** and run the app:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Create a branch** (use a short, descriptive name):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/typo-landing
   # or
   git checkout -b feat/add-widget-export
   ```
6. **Make your changes** — follow [Code Style](#code-style--architecture) and [Commit Convention](#commit-convention).
7. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npx vitest run
   ```
8. **Commit** with a clear message (see [Commit Convention](#commit-convention)):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: correct typo in Hero subheadline"
   ```
9. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin fix/typo-landing
   ```
10. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub against the **main** branch. Fill in the PR template and link any related issue (e.g. `Fixes #123`).

### Keeping your fork in sync

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

Then rebase your feature branch on `main` if needed: `git rebase main`.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **One logical change per PR** — keep PRs focused so they’re easier to review.
2. **Tests** — new features and bug fixes should include or update tests in `src/test/`.
3. **No breaking changes** without prior discussion in an issue.
4. **Docs** — if behavior or setup changes, update README, CONTRIBUTING, or in-app guides.
5. **UI changes** — add a short description and, if helpful, a screenshot or GIF.
6. **CI** — ensure the test suite passes; maintainers will review and may request changes.

After approval, a maintainer will merge your PR. Thank you for contributing.

---

## Documentation & Content

- **README, CONTRIBUTING, docs** — fix typos, clarify steps, add examples.
- **In-app guides** — edit `src/lib/guides-data.ts` to add or change steps.
- **Blog / SEO content** — edit `src/lib/blog-data.ts`; follow existing structure and hadith guidelines.
- **Marketing copy** — expand or refine content in `src/marketing/` (see `src/marketing/README.md`).
- **Landing page** — copy and structure live in `src/components/landing/` and `src/pages/Index.tsx`.

When editing Islamic or hadith-related content, follow [Islamic Content Guidelines](#islamic-content-guidelines).

---

## Translations

We want MosqueSteps to be usable in multiple languages. Priority languages: **Arabic**, **Turkish**, **Urdu**, **Malay**, **Indonesian**, **French**.

- **Where:** Translation keys and locale logic live in `src/lib/i18n.ts` and related hooks (`useLocale`, etc.).
- **How:** Add or extend locale objects with translated strings; ensure RTL is considered for Arabic (and other RTL languages if added).
- **Scope:** Start with landing page and key app strings; full UI translation can be done incrementally.
- Open an issue or PR describing the language and which screens you’re translating.

---

## Mosque Data (OpenStreetMap)

MosqueSteps does **not** store mosque data. We use **OpenStreetMap** (Overpass API). To fix missing or wrong mosques:

1. Go to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and create an account if needed.
2. Search for the area and **edit the map** (add or correct the mosque).
3. Tag the place with `amenity=place_of_worship` and `religion=muslim`. Add name, address, and location.
4. Save. Changes usually appear in MosqueSteps after OSM updates (can take a short while).

You can still [open a Mosque Data issue](https://github.com/ummahbuild/mosquesteps/issues/new?template=mosque_data.md) if you want us to know about a problem or can’t edit OSM yourself.

---

## Code Style & Architecture

- **TypeScript** — Strict typing; avoid `any` where possible.
- **React** — Functional components and hooks; no class components.
- **Styling** — Tailwind CSS with **semantic tokens** (`text-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `border-border`, etc.). Do not introduce raw hex/hsl unless necessary.
- **UI** — Prefer existing **shadcn/ui** components in `src/components/ui/`.
- **File size** — Keep components focused; split if a file grows beyond ~200 lines.
- **Naming** — PascalCase for components; camelCase for functions/variables; kebab-case for file names where applicable.

### Folder structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/` | Reusable UI components |
| `src/components/landing/` | Landing page sections (Hero, Features, FAQ, etc.) |
| `src/components/ui/` | shadcn/ui primitives |
| `src/pages/` | Route-level page components (lazy-loaded) |
| `src/lib/` | Business logic, utilities, data (prayer-times, walking-history, badges, etc.) |
| `src/hooks/` | Custom React hooks |
| `src/test/` | Vitest test suites |
| `src/marketing/` | Marketing docs and research (see `src/marketing/README.md`) |

---

## Commit Convention

| Prefix | Use for |
|--------|--------|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation only (README, CONTRIBUTING, comments) |
| `style:` | Formatting, whitespace, no logic change |

## Islamic Content Guidelines

When contributing **hadith references** or **Islamic educational content**:

- Use only **authenticated hadiths** (Sahih or Hasan grade). Avoid weak or disputed narrations.
- Always include the **source** (e.g. Sahih Muslim 666, Sunan Abi Dawud 561).
- **Link to sunnah.com** (or another trusted source) for verification where possible.
- Include **Arabic text** when available and ensure it is correct.
- Be **respectful** of different schools of thought; avoid content that disparages any madhhab or group.
- Use **ﷺ** after mentioning the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).
- Use **Allah** (not “God”) in Islamic contexts in the app and docs.

---

## Testing

- **Run all tests:** `npx vitest run`
- **Watch mode:** `npx vitest --watch`
- **Single file:** `npx vitest run src/test/landing.test.tsx`
- **Stack:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Location:** Tests live in `src/test/`. Add tests for new features and bug fixes; update existing tests when behavior changes.
